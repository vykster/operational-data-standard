By that, we mean it is built around trip (or journey) planning and the information that riders need to know to complete a trip.

Critical information for operators\u2014for example, which driver is scheduled to serve a given trip, when and where to layover, or how deadheads should be completed\u2014is not included in GTFS at present.
